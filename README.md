# Simple Tip Calculator

This repository contains two versions of a simple console-based Python program that calculates a tip based on a user's input for the total bill.

##  About

This was my first Python project, created to get comfortable with basic programming concepts like user input, arithmetic, and formatting output. This will be part of an ongoing series to constantly improve the tip calculator as I continue to learn programming. The first version was a fixed 20% tip calculator. Later, I built a second version that lets the user choose their own tip percentage and includes basic error handling.

##  What's Included

- **`tipcalculator.py`** — The original version: calculates a 20% tip on any bill amount. Completed 5/19/2025
- **`tipcalculatorv2.py`** — The improved version: asks the user for a custom tip percentage and handles invalid input gracefully. Completed 5/20/2025

##  How It Works

### Version 1:
1. Asks for the total bill.
2. Calculates 20% of the bill.
3. Prints the tip amount.

### Version 2:
1. Asks for the total bill.
2. Prompts for a custom tip percentage.
3. Calculates and prints the tip, rounded to two decimal places.
4. Includes basic error handling (e.g. if the user types in letters instead of numbers).

##  Technologies Used

- Python 3
- PyCharm (code editor)

##  What I Learned

- How to use `input()`, `float()`, and `print()`
- How to do calculations with user-provided values
- How to format numbers with `.2f` for currency
- How to catch input errors with `try` / `except`
- How to iterate and improve on a project

##  Next Steps

This project helped me build a foundation in Python. In the future, I’d like to:

- Add a bill-splitting feature (e.g. for multiple people)
- Include a menu of tip options (10%, 15%, 20%)
- Make a GUI version using Tkinter
- Turn it into a basic web app using Flask

Thanks for checking out my first real coding project! Feedback and suggestions are always welcome.
