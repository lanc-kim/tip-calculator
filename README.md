# Tip Calculator (My First Python Project)

This is a simple console-based Python program that calculates a 20% tip based on a user's input for the total bill.

## About

This project marks my first steps into Python programming. The goal was to create a small app to practice the basics: handling user input, performing calculations, and formatting results. While I wrote most of the code myself, I used resources like ChatGPT to help me debug and improve some parts of the program.

## How It Works

When you run the program, it will:

1. Ask the user for the total bill amount.
2. Calculate 20% of that amount.
3. Display the tip, formatted as a dollar amount.

## Technologies Used

- Python 3
- PyCharm (as my code editor)

## What I Learned

- How to use `input()` and `print()` functions
- How to convert string input to float for calculations
- How to format numbers with 2 decimal places using `round()` and f-strings
- How to structure a basic Python script

## Next Steps

This project was a great starting point for my Python learning. In the future, I plan to:

- Let users choose a custom tip percentage.
- Add error handling for invalid input.
- Experiment with a graphical interface or build a web version.

Thanks for checking out my first project!
